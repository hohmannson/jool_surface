In brief, it regenerates Jool according to its original 0.17 colormap, but in modern quality, and
adds nice procedural wasteland on its surface, that only becomes visible when clouds fade out (~75km).
It should be compatible with any mod that don't touch Jool by Kopernicus patches. EVE, Scatterer, should be OK.

Suggested mods:

Visual packs. Will add true clouds that can be seen from surface.
EveEngines, ExplodiumBreathingEngines. Absolutely must have for flying there.
Any mods with electric jets or propellers - RationalResources, KAX, you got it.
Also, Jool remains ore-abundant with RationalResources so you won't run out of fuel

If you feel need to touch it by Kopernicus patches, use JooI, not Jool (last letter is big "i")

Have fun, report bugs!
